# Directions for Candidate
test 
Your task will be to create a baseline machine learning model. Starting from raw data files, you will parse the data, generate features, train a basic model of your choosing, and test it.
 
* You will have 120 minutes to complete this coding challenge. 
* The time will begin with an email from the hiring manager containing link to a git repository.
* Download the repo and create a new branch named `<your_first_name>-<your_last_name>`, e.g. `jane-smith`.
* Carefully read the task description at the top of prompt.ipynb
* The hiring manager may ask you to include incremental commits, to demonstrate software development practices.
* Please ensure that you've budgeted enough time to submit your code.

## Preparation
This challenge is Python-based. You'll need the following tools/libraries installed:
* git
* Python 3.X
* numpy/pandas
* scikit-learn (or a machine learning library of your choice)
* Jupyter


## Repo structure
* `README.md`: this description
* `prompt.ipynb`: contains the task description and stubbed out functions for you to complete
* `data/`: directory containing raw data files to be used for the task
* Any other files can be safely ignored
